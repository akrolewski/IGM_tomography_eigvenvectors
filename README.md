# IGM_tomography_eigvenvectors
computes eigenvectors of the (pseudo)-deformation tensor for cosmic web analysis of IGM tomography

compute_deformation_tensor.py: computes (pseudo)-deformation tensor from a gridded field
eigenvectors_example.py: working example script that computes deformation tensor on redshift-space matter density from Nyx box,
plus pseudo-deformation tensor from delta_F from Nyx box
